# vol 5

> July 2011



## what's new

- Tools for effectively delivering and testing mobile web
- Simple techniques for testing and obtaining performance
- Several new approaches to business intelligence
- Continued emphasis on continuous delivery and web based architectures



## tech

- continuous delivery(not the same as continuous deployment, which means deploying every change to production)
- infrastructure as code
- evolutionary architecture
- event API
- Procedure oriented integration
- thoughtful caching(深思熟虑的缓存)
- simple performance trending
- evolutionary database
- Automated database deployment

- manual infrastructure management（All of these activities, if not fully automated, should at least be scripted and repeatable across environments.）
- feature branching
- progressive enhancement
- **Event sourcing** is an approach to thinking about persistent data where the primary record is a log of all events that make updates
- Decision driven business intelligence
- Iterative data warehousing
- Data visualizations



## Tools

- Infrastructure as code：Network switch, firewall and load balancer configuration can be infrastructure as code, and even changed at runtime
- Sonar
- code in configuration
- Test Load Balancer (TLB)
- Backbone.js
- Git
- version control systems with “implicit workflow“
- jQuery Mobile
- Selenium 2 mobile tests（to run the same acceptance tests on iOS, Android and Blackberry）
- cross platform mobile toolkits
- NoSQL
- Open source BI tools
- New Relic
- Powershell
- Gradle 



## Platforms

- Mobile web => adopt
- offline mobile web applications
- Tablet devices
- Ubiquitous computing
- OAuth
- AWS
- Cloud Foundry
- Heroku is a beautifully simple Platform as a Service (PaaS).
- Java Portal Server 
- GWT 
- WS-* stack



## Languages

- HTML5
- clojure
- Coffeescript
- business logic in stored procedures (Programming languages commonly used to implement stored procedures lack expressiveness, are difficult to test, and discourage clean modular design)

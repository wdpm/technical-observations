## what's new

- Continued development of alternatives to SQL datastores
- Treating all code from UI to tests with respect
- Increasing diversification and rigor in browser based languages and technologies
- Smaller, simpler and faster applications and services



## Techniques

- Emergent design
- evolutionary architecture
- Micro-services(This approach trades benefits such as maintainability for additional operational complexity.)
- server / application container end-of-life
- **Embedding a servlet container**, such as Jetty, inside a Java application has many advantages over running the application inside a container
- out-of-container functional testing
- Experience Design (XD)
- mechanical sympathy
- health check pages
- single command deploy
- production immune system
- infrastructure automation of development workstations.
- Windows infrastructure automation
- data visualizations of development and operations
- test at the appropriate level
- performance testing as a first class citizen



##  Tools

- **Polyglot persistence** is the technique of storing data in various data stores based on efficiency and how that data is going to be used
- Using **NoSQL** databases like MongoDB, Riak and Neo4J allows us to reconsider how data is treated, even with-in a single application
- Riak
- **JavaScript micro frameworks**：Microjs.com hosts a collection of these micro frameworks, as well as a tool that can bundle them into a single library.
- **Frank** is an open source library that allows functional tests for iPhones and iPads to be written in Cucumber and executed on a remote device

- continue to highlight **infrastructure as code**
- **FPM** is a useful tool which makes it easy to create RPM, DEB, or Solaris packages with a minimum of fuss.
-  NuGet for .NET
- **PSake** (pronounced ‘sake’ like the Japanese rice wine) is a build automation tool implemented in PowerShell.
- Maven and Gradle



## Platforms

- NodeJS: single threaded servers with asynchronous I/O 
- private cloud
- **Hybrid clouds** describe a set of patterns that combine the best features of public clouds and private data centers
- **AppHarbor** is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering for the .NET Platform
- Linux containers such as **OpenVZ** provide the isolation and management benefits of a virtual machine without the overhead usually associated with general-purpose virtualization
- domain-specific PaaS
- Windows Phone 7
- OpenSocial
- communication between those responsible for hardware and software.
- treating virtual machines like physical infrastructure

## Languages

- care about languages(may find skills constrain choice)
- Microsoft’s F# continues to evolve
- JavaScript as a “first class” language

- **Dart** is Google’s attempt at creating a programming language to replace JavaScript due to JavaScript’s perceived flaws and
  inherent performance issues
